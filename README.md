# A Computer Science Paper Search Engine

A simple search engine for computer science papers with two modes of retrieval:  
- **Syntactic Search**: Traditional keyword-based matching  
- **Semantic Search**: Embedding-based similarity search for contextual results

## üîç Overview

This project demonstrates a dual-search interface over a corpus of academic papers:
- **Syntactic Search** uses traditional information retrieval methods.
- **Semantic Search** leverages embeddings from pre-trained language models to retrieve contextually relevant documents, even when exact keywords don't match.

Use cases include:
- Quickly finding relevant research papers
- Exploring related work through vector-based semantic similarity
- Comparing traditional vs modern retrieval techniques
